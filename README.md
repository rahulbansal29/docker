# docker-gettingstarted

1) Install Docker on your VM with the help of the following commands (only for Ubuntu and Debian Operating Systems)

  install packages:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y \
        apt-transport-https \
        ca-certificates \
        curl \
        gnupg \
        lsb-release \
        jq
        
  Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
    
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
setup repository:

    echo \
      "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
      $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
      
Install Docker Engine:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
    Add your user to the docker group:

    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    
Docker Compose
download the current stable release of Docker Compose:

    COMPOSE_VERSION=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/tags" | jq -r '.[0].name')
    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/${COMPOSE_VERSION}/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" \
      -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
Apply executable permissions to the binary:

    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

2)Pull nginx & hello-world:  
  
        docker pull hello-world
        docker pull nginx

3)Port forward nginx to port 80: <br>
    `docker run --name mynginxl -p 80:80 -d nginx`

Open your public ip after successfully executing this commaND.

4)View images: <br>

  `docker images`

5)Pull apache2: <br>

   `docker pull ubuntu/apache2`

6) Kill nginx to allocate port 80 to apache2: <br>
   `docker kill <container_id_nginx>`

  To grab the container id of nginx, run `docker ps`

7) Finally, port apache2 to port 80: <br>
   `docker run --name apache -p 80:80 -d ubuntu/apache2`
   and reopen your public ip.
8) Next up, we can implement networking b/w 2 or multiple containers using bridges.
9) We could also share files b/w 2 containers by creating a docker volume.
10) Containerd is a docker container runtime, which is high level and comprises runc + high level functions.
11) Dockerfile can be used to provide the format and configurations of a docker image, which can later be used to create containers (using docker build).
12) One can also expose and publish the container's ports to the host machine.
13) --network flag can be used while running a container to connect it to some local network (like for example: Localhost)
14) -it flag to open the container in an interactive mode.
15) --rm to flag to immediately end the container after the use.
16) -v to mount some hosts directory to the container.


## Dockerfile:
Commands:
 - COPY
 - EXPOSE
 - WORKDIR
 - CMD
 - RUN
 - FROM 
 
 1. COPY in dockerfile only takes in relative paths, all the other paths must be added in the build context. 
2. WORKDIR creates a new directory in the container if it doesnt exist. 
3. RUN mkdir is used to create a directory in the container's filesystem.

4. Expose the port so that the app running in the container can listen on that port

5. After that we publish that port to the host so that we can access it from the anywhere in the host's system (provided the container is running)
This is done using `docker run -p or -P commands`. We can also use something like this : `81:80` which mounts the host's port 81 to the container's port 80.
